## Data Storage

The extension uses a two-tier storage approach:

1. **Primary**: File System Access API - Saves data to a local JSON file (`linkedin-notes.json`)
2. **Fallback**: Chrome Storage API - If File System Access is not available

### File System Access API

- On first use, you'll be prompted to choose a location for the notes file
- The file handle is saved for future use
- Data is stored in JSON format with profile IDs as keys

### Chrome Storage Fallback

- If File System Access API is not supported or fails
- Data is stored in the browser's local storage
- Accessible via `chrome.storage.local`
